# Firebase Authentication Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Firebase Username Uniqueness Check
- **Problem**: Users could create accounts with duplicate usernames
- **Solution**: Added Firebase username existence check in both UserManagement.jsx and EmployeeManagement.jsx
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `UserManagement.jsx` - Added async Firebase checks in handleSubmit and handleEditSubmit
  - `EmployeeManagement.jsx` - Added Firebase username check when creating user accounts
  - `firebase.js` - Added better error handling and checkUsernameExists function

### 2. Changed "Employees" to "Staff"
- **Problem**: UI showed "Employees" instead of "Staff"
- **Solution**: Updated all text references from "Employee" to "Staff"
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `EmployeeManagement.jsx` - Updated all UI text and labels

### 3. Login Credentials Not Working for Super Manager Created Users
- **Problem**: Users created by super manager couldn't log in
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced user creation process to properly save to Firebase
  - Improved login authentication with Firebase and local fallback
  - Added better error handling and logging
- **Files Modified**:
  - `App.jsx` - Enhanced handleCreateUserAccount and handleEditUserAccount functions
  - `LoginForm.jsx` - Added Firebase authentication with local fallback
  - `firebase.js` - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

## Key Improvements:

1. **Robust Username Validation**: Now checks both local storage and Firebase for duplicate usernames
2. **Better Error Handling**: All Firebase operations now have proper try-catch blocks with logging
3. **Authentication Fallback**: Login system tries Firebase first, then falls back to local storage
4. **Consistent Data Sync**: User data is saved to both Firebase and local storage for reliability
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Added console logs to track user operations for debugging

## Testing Recommendations:

1. Create a new user account via super manager
2. Verify the user can log in with the created credentials
3. Try creating a user with an existing username (should be blocked)
4. Test login with both Firebase-stored and locally-stored users
5. Verify all "Employee" references are now "Staff"
